        My name is Safynaz Tarek Elsagheir,
        \n\nI am a holder of B.Sc. degree in Computer and Communication at the faculty of Engineering, Alexandria University, Egypt (2017 – 2022).
        \n\nI graduated this spring semester on July, 2022.
        \n\nI am a former software engineer at Made in Alexandria Robotics Team in Alexandria, Egypt.
        \nDuring my time in the team, I worked in developing a communication system using QT framework and coded in C++ to control
        an underwater remotely operated vehicle [ROV].
        \nThis system is developed as part of my work for the 2020- 2021 international MATE ROV competition that took place in America.
        \n\nI also interned at IHUB-ASU in Cairo, Egypt, where I got a chance to work with Microsoft’s latest Azure Kinect Developers Kit.
        The project included utilizing the camera in developing a rehabilitation application. In this project,
        \nI was responsible for Tracking and visualizing skeletons in 2D plane and developing the needed exercises using C# and Visual Studio.
